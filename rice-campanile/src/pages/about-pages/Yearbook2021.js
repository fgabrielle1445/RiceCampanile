                    We want to provide the campus community with an update on the 2021 volume of the Campanile yearbook. We received the books a few weeks ago, and as we prepared to distribute them, we discovered a problem with the book. 

We pride ourselves on accurately and fairly capturing the events, trends and people who make each year at Rice memorable and special. Part of the 2021 book failed to meet our standards, and we believe the campus deserves our best effort. 

We are addressing the issue, and we hope to have the books ready for distribution in February 2022. We appreciate your patience as we produce the book the campus deserves. 

For the class of 2021 members who received a book in the mail, we plan to send you an updated copy of the 2021 yearbook. If you have changed your address, please email yearbook@rice.edu  to provide a new address. 

If you have any questions at all, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at yearbook@rice.edu or klash@rice.edu. 

Thank you, 

The Campanile staff
