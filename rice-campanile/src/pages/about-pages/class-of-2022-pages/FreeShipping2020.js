                    <p>Hello! We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy! Just a quick update from the Campanile yearbook regarding the distribution of our 2019-2020 book – there is a lot of uncertainty going into the fall about what campus is going to look like and because not everyone is going to return to campus, we wanted to extend the senior shipping opportunity to students in all years! The link provided is for students to sign up to have your book shipped directly to your home address (unfortunately, we do not ship outside of the US)

Feel free to contact Amy Zhang or Phoebe Dang if you have questions! Thanks and love y’all ❤</p>
